Instructions for use

To use this program it is necessary to have virtual serial ports installed on your PC.

You can use any of the ISIS simulation files (For the PIC12F629 or PIC12F675)
Run the MT8870 Coder.exe program and select virtual COM port Number 3
Start the simulation and press the Connect button on the interface to start communication.
Press the digits corresponding to the DTMF tones to generate the corresponding output on the simulator chip.
The microcontroller will respond to the digits pressed on the interface and can be used in your projects, replacing the MT8870 chip and the like.
You can also use the (Keep to Front) checkbox to have the interface always visible.

Notes:
The tones generated by the interface and the selection of audio quality are not taken into account by the microcontroller.
